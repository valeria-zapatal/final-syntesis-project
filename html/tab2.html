  <span class="subtitulos">Color codes to consider a star cold or hot:</span>
  <br /><br />
  The surface color of the stars depends on their temperature and age, the
  youngest stars have a bluish color, and the oldest stars have a red color
  tone, this is due to if the star is young and has less mass, more energy and
  temperature it can reach.
  <br />
  <br />
  However, the relation between their age and temperature is not universal,
  because if the star is bigger, their fuel will be consumed faster and will
  become in a red tonality in less time range. If the star has less mass, its
  “life” time will be more durable and it will become red in less time.

  The shades that a star acquires along their live can go from a red to a bluish
  tonality, being the last tonality the hottest. The electromagnetic spectrum
  explains this, talking about the ultraviolet and infrared light, being de last
  one the most intense, this implies that the blue color has stronger and
  energetic radiations, this is the reason why the stars with this color are the
  hottest in the classification of heat scale.

  <br />
  <span class="subtitulos">The woman that classified the stars:</span>
  <br /><br />
  Annie Jump Cannon, was the girl that discovered this technique of classifying
  stars according to their shape, size, color, and other characteristics, she
  was based in something called spectral classification. She explained that at
  the moment we look at the stars, there was always colored lines missing in the
  rainbow they emit, this is because there are different atoms and molecules
  with different shapes that can absorb different colors or light waves lengths.
  <br /><br />

  <br /><br />
  The missing lines in the rainbow are called spectral and the pattern that they
  produce is different in each star, because every atom and particle absorb a
  different specifically amount of light, being a type of fingerprint, which
  depending of the density of the lines, this allow us to classify them with the
  letters: O, B, A, F, G, K and M. In the letter “O” we include the hottest,
  shiny and blue tonality stars, while in letter “M”, we find the “coldest” and
  red colored stars.

    >The melting process inside the sun that makes the electromagnetic radiation
    waves possible:</span
  >
  <br /><br />
  The process that the sun makes for its waves of electromagnetic energy to get
  to the earth is that two lightweight atoms of hydrogen and their isotopes
  merge to create a heavy nucleus, releasing a big amount of energy and helium,
  which get into the earth in an electromagnetic radiation way, short radiation
  waves mainly in ultraviolet, visible and infrared near with waves lengths
  between 200nm to 300nm. We have to consider that all that allows this process
  is the sun’s temperature (5,772K) since the nuclear fusion needs thermic
  energy (heat) to perform.
