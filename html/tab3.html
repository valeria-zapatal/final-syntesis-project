  <span class="subtitulos">What is astrobiology?</span>
  <br /><br />
  How does life begin and evolve? Is there life in other planets? Are we alone
  in the universe?. For centuries, man has considered these fundamental
  questions about the origin and evolution of life. The Astrobiology is the
  scientific discipline dedicated to responding to these questions.

  <br /><br />
  Astrobiology is the science that focuses on the study and exploration of life
  in the stars. More specifically, the origin, evolution, distribution of life
  in the universe, the search for habitable planets and how humans can know
  them, if it exists. Other facts that it study for understand, are the
  conditions and processes that make it possible for life to appear in our
  planet. Astrobiology uses a variety of scientific disciplines such as
  astrophysics, planetary sciences, atmospheric sciences, geology, chemistry,
  evolutionary biology, molecular biology and others. The previous ones provide
  the theoretical support to this branches of knowledge.
  <br /><br />
  <span class="subtitulos">Why study astrobiology?</span>
  <br /><br />
  Astrobiology is an exciting and constantly evolving discipline that combines
  various fields of science to study the origin, evolution, distribution, and
  future of life in the universe. Its relevance lies in the search for answers
  to fundamental questions about the existence of life elsewhere in the cosmos
  and our understanding of the role of Earth in the universe. If you have an
  interest in chemistry, physics, and biology, astrobiology can be an attractive
  option for studying and satisfying your curiosity.

    >What are the greatest contributions that astrobiology has made?</span
  >
  <br /><br />
  Although it is a relatively young branch of science, astrobiology has made
  significant contributions to our understanding of the cosmos and our place in
  it. Some of the major contributions of astrobiology are:
  <br /><br />
  Discovery of exoplanets: Astrobiology has been a key tool in the discovery of
  exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars other than the Sun. Exoplanets
  contribute to the investigation of the possibility of life elsewhere in the
  universe, and have provided information about the diversity and distribution
  of planetary systems in the galaxy. The identification of habitable exoplanets
  is crucial for the search for life elsewhere in the universe.

  />
  <br /><br />
  Search for life in the universe: Astrobiology has laid the groundwork for the
  search for life on other planets and moons in the solar system, as well as on
  exoplanets, as mentioned above. Instruments and techniques have been developed
  to detect any signs of life.
  <br /><br />

    width="350px"
    height="220"
  />
  <br /><br />
  Study of planetary habitability: Astrobiology has contributed to defining the
  parameters that make a planet habitable for the life as we know it. These
  parameters include the distance from the sun or the star it orbits, the
  presence of liquid water, an atmosphere that allows for the presence of life,
  climate stability, among others.

    height="250px"
  />
  <br /><br />
  Research on the origin and evolution of life: Astrobiology has helped in the
  understanding of how life originated and evolved on Earth, and explores the
  possibility of life having originated and evolved elsewhere in the universe.
  By studying the necessary conditions for the emergence of life, as mentioned
  above, such as planetary habitability, astrobiology seeks evidence of life in
  other parts of the universe.

  />
  <br /><br />
  Interdisciplinary research: Astrobiology has fostered and brought back
  collaboration among different scientific disciplines, leading to new
  perspectives and research methods that enrich science as a whole.
  <br /><br />
  In summary, astrobiology has been a discipline that has improved our
  understanding of life in the universe and has opened up possibilities for
  exploration and the search for life beyond Earth.

    The most recent discoveries in the world of astrobiology.</span
  >
  <br /><br />
  In recent years, astrobiology has made significant advancements in
  understanding the origin of life and the possibility of life in other parts of
  the universe. Below, we will present some of the most recent discoveries in
  this field.
  <br /><br />
  Advancements in the study of exoplanets: James Webb, a scientist at NASA, is
  conducting research on the atmospheres of exoplanets. The James Webb telescope
  is an advanced instrument designed to study distant astronomical objects,
  including exoplanets, which are planets outside of our solar system.
  <br /><br />
  <img
    id="astrobiologia7"
    src="imagenes/telescopio.jpeg"
    width="300px"
    height="190px"
  />
  The James Webb telescope is being used to study the atmospheres of multiple
  exoplanets by analyzing the light that passes through their atmospheres when
  they transit in front of their stars. Scientists can use these measurements to
  identify the components of the atmospheres, including gases like hydrogen,
  helium, oxygen, and methane, which are important for determining the
  habitability of planets.
  <br /><br />
  Studying the atmospheres of exoplanets is a significant area of research in
  astrobiology, as it can provide information about the presence of liquid water
  and the possibility of life on other planets. With the James Webb telescope,
  scientists can continue advancing our understanding of exoplanets and their
  habitability, and help answer one of the most intriguing questions in
  astrobiology: Are we alone in the universe?
  <br /><br />
  Advancements in the understanding of the origin of life: A new theory suggests
  that Earth's water did not come from the melting of meteorites, as previously
  believed, but rather it could have been released by early volcanic activity on
  Earth. This is relevant to astrobiology because water is an essential
  component for the emergence of life as we know it. Understanding the source of
  water on Earth can also help us understand how life may have originated on
  other similar planets.

  <br /><br />
  Hypotheses and theories about the origin of life: Various theories are being
  discussed regarding the origins of life, including the RNA world hypothesis,
  the iron-sulfur world hypothesis, the prebiotic metabolism theory, among
  others. Astrobiology also examines how the principles and laws of physics may
  have influenced the processes that led to the emergence of life on Earth, and
  how these principles could be applied to the search for life in other parts of
  the universe.

    >Why is it believed that there was water on Mars?</span
  >
  <br /><br />
  Mars may have been a wet place in the past, with evidence of massive river
  channels indicating the presence of large amounts of water. However, these
  proofs are contradictory and the issue of water on Mars remains a subject of
  debate and research.
  <br /><br />

  <br /><br />
  Some scientists propose that the rivers that formed the channels occurred
  simultaneously, releasing enough water to form an ocean in the northern
  hemisphere of the planet. Others suggest that Mars may have gone through
  cycles of warming and cooling, releasing groundwater and forming temporary
  oceans that were then absorbed back under the planet's crust and froze.

  <br /><br />
  The valley network on Mars, especially in the southern highlands, also
  presents an enigma. Some scientists initially believed that these valleys were
  formed by rainfall runoff, but this would imply that Mars had a much thicker
  atmosphere in the past. Other theories suggest that these valleys were formed
  by processes of soil collapse due to groundwater or the action of melting
  glaciers. However, a clear explanation has not been found.
  <br /><br />
  In addition, recent images from the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) have shown signs
  of water runoff in various locations on Mars, far from the equator, forming
  small gullies. Some scientists speculate that this may have occurred recently,
  while others suggest that it may have happened millions of years ago.

  <br /><br />
  Despite advances in research, there is no conclusive evidence to confirm or
  completely rule out these theories, and the debate about water on Mars
  continues. Scientists are still striving to obtain clear answers to this
  Martian enigma.

  <br /><br />
  The rover sent to Mars is a robotic vehicle designed to explore the surface of
  the red planet and carry out various scientific tasks. To date, several rovers
  have been sent to Mars by different space agencies such as NASA (United
  States) and ESA (Europe), including the Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and
  Perseverance rovers.
  <br /><br />
  These rovers have conducted a series of activities on Mars, such as collecting
  geological data, searching for evidence of past liquid water, analyzing the
  chemical and mineral composition of Martian rocks and soil, identifying
  possible signs of past or present life, and conducting experiments to
  understand the Martian atmosphere and climate.

  <br /><br />
  The first rover to arrive on Mars was NASA's Sojourner rover in 1997, followed
  by the Spirit and Opportunity rovers in 2004, which far exceeded their initial
  90-day mission and explored Mars for years, discovering evidence of past
  liquid water and providing valuable information about Martian geology.
  <br /><br />
  The Curiosity rover, which arrived on Mars in 2012, has made significant
  discoveries, including the identification of ancient river channels,
  confirmation that Mars had the necessary conditions to support life in the
  past, and the discovery of organic molecules in Martian soil, which are
  considered building blocks for life as we know it.

  <br /><br />
  The most recent rover sent to Mars is Perseverance, which landed in February
  2021. So far, it has conducted a series of activities, including searching for
  signs of past life, collecting samples of Martian rocks for future return to
  Earth, and testing advanced technologies such as an autonomous helicopter
  named Ingenuity. It is expected that Perseverance will continue to make
  important discoveries during its ongoing mission.
