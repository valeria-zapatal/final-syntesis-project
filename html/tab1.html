  <span class="subtitulos">Which exoplanets have been detected?</span>
  <br /><br />
  More than 4,000 confirmed exoplanets have been discovered in orbit around
  distant stars. Some of the best known exoplanets are Kepler-438b, TRAPPIST-1e,
  Proxima Centauri b, HD 209458 b, WASP-12b, 55 Cancri e.

  Are considered potentially habitable because they are located in the habitable
  zone of their stars, which means that they could have suitable conditions for
  the existence of liquid water on their surface and, therefore, for life as we
  know it. Kepler-452b, Trappist-1e, f and g, Proxima Centauri b, Ross 128 b, it
  is still uncertain whether they have the right conditions for life. Further
  studies and observations will be needed to confirm whether there is life on
  these worlds.

  Detecting an exoplanet is tricky because planets are much smaller and faint
  even faster than the stars they orbit, making them hard to see directly. Also,
  planets do not emit their own light, but instead reflect light from their
  star, making them even more difficult to detect. The most common techniques
  and their limitations, Transit method, Radial velocity method, Gravitational
  microlensing method, Direct images.

  <span class="subtitulos">What is a planet itself?</span>
  <br /><br />
  A planet is a body that orbits around a star and that has enough mass to have
  a spherical shape due to gravity. Originally, the planets were considered
  objects that moved with respect to the stars and did not appear to have a
  regular shape. A planet meets three criteria: it must orbit a star, it must
  have enough mass to be spherical in shape due to gravity, it must have cleared
  its orbit of other objects of similar size. If an object meets these three
  criteria, it is considered a planet. If it meets only the first two criteria,
  but not the third, it is classified as a “dwarf planet.”

  The closest exoplanet and considered the strongest candidate for habitability
  is Proxima Centauri b, which is located at a distance of approximately 4.2
  light-years from Earth in the habitable zone of its star. However, despite
  being the closest exoplanet and having the possibility of being habitable,
  very little is still known about its size, composition, and physical
  characteristics. The gravitational acceleration of Proxima Centauri b will
  depend on its mass and size, which are not yet known with certainty. Its
  radius is also unknown, but it is estimated to have a mass similar to that of
  Earth. Regarding its composition, Proxima Centauri b is believed to be a rocky
  planet, similar in composition to Earth.
